# Kozyrev-Mirrors-Notes

Nikolai Kozyrev was a Russian astrophysicist in the 20th century who is best known for his work on the properties of time and his study of torsion fields. Among his many interests, he postulated the existence of a form of energy related to time, which he believed could be harnessed.

*Kozyrev Mirrors* are experimental apparatuses that are purportedly based on Kozyrev's theories. They are typically constructed as a series of reflective surfaces, usually in cylindrical or conical shapes, intended to concentrate or focus the hypothetical torsion fields and other energies. It's worth noting that while these mirrors are named after Kozyrev, there's limited direct evidence that he himself created or used such devices.

Proponents of Kozyrev Mirrors suggest that they have a range of applications, from facilitating altered states of consciousness to improving health and well-being. There have been claims that being inside a Kozyrev Mirror chamber can induce various perceptions or experiences.

However, the mainstream scientific community remains skeptical of these claims, as they often lack rigorous experimental evidence and often conflict with well-established principles of physics.

If you're considering engaging with Kozyrev Mirrors or any related practices, it's essential to approach the subject with an open but critical mind and to seek out credible information.
